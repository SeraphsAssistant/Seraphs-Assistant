Seraph's Assistant
Seraph's Assistant is a powerful, highly customizable hotkey automation tool designed specifically for the MMORPG Flyff Universe. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) to create and manage complex macros for support characters (like Ringmasters and Psykeepers), allowing them to perform their roles with maximum efficiency.

The application is built with a secure client-server architecture for license management and includes an auto-updater to ensure users always have the latest version.

Key Features
Powerful Macro Engine: Create any number of custom hotkeys with three distinct types:

Single: A single key press.

Loop: A key press that repeats on a randomized timer.

Sequence: A series of different key presses executed in order with a set delay.

Full Modifier Key Support: All macro types support Ctrl (^), Alt (!), and Shift (+), allowing for complex key combinations (e.g., ^1, !F2, +5).

Profile Management: Create and manage separate, dedicated profiles for each of your characters. Each profile saves its own unique set of hotkeys and settings.

In-Game Overlay: An interactive in-game overlay provides easy access to your macros without leaving the game window.

Customizable Layout: Choose between a vertical or horizontal button layout.

Active Loop Indicator: A persistent on-screen display (OSD) clearly shows all currently active loop macros. The indicator can be set to follow the mouse or remain static.

Secure Online Activation: The software is protected by a secure online activation system. Each license key is locked to a single machine to prevent unauthorized sharing and is managed through a subscription-based model.

Installation & Setup (For End-Users)
Prerequisites: Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

A Windows operating system.

AutoHotkey v1.1 installed on your system. You can download it from the official website. Note: This tool is not compatible with AutoHotkey v2.

Download: Download the latest Seraphs_Assistant.exe from the official source.

First Run & Activation:

Run the executable. On the first launch, it will prompt you to enter your license key.

Enter the key you received upon purchase. The application will contact the server to activate your license for your machine.

Creating a Profile:

Click the "New Profile" button and give your profile a name (e.g., your character's name). A new tab for that profile will be created.

Configuration:

General Settings: In the top section, select your Target Browser (Flyff Universe is a browser-based game) and set your desired hotkeys for suspending the script (F12) and toggling the overlay (F11).

Adding a Hotkey:

In the "Hotkey Details" panel, fill in the fields:

Name: A descriptive name for your macro (e.g., "Heal", "Buffs").

Type: Choose single, loop, or sequence.

Trigger Hotkey: The key you will press to activate the macro (e.g., F1, ^2).

Key to Send: The key the macro will send to the game (e.g., 1, !3).

Click "Add / Update Hotkey". The new macro will appear in the list.

Generate & Launch:

Once your profile is configured, click the large "Generate & Launch Script for This Profile" button at the bottom.

This will create a custom .ahk helper script and run it in the background. The assistant is now active!

Usage
Suspending Hotkeys: Press your designated Suspend/Resume key (default: F12) at any time to temporarily disable all macros.

In-Game Overlay: Press your Toggle Overlay key (default: F11) to show or hide the overlay inside the game window. You can click the buttons on the overlay to trigger your macros.

Active Loops: When you activate a loop macro, its name will appear in the on-screen status indicator, so you always know what's running.
